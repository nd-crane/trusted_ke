Both vehicles which are armored can house up to twenty five marines /.
This time there were fifteen inside the AAV /.
Fourteen died /.
and one civilian translator was also killed /.
Now this occured in basically the same area where <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">six marines</COREF> were killed <COREF ID="311" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> in an ambush launched by insurgents /.
<COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">The six marines</COREF> were snipers located on a roof looking for insurgents travelling down a smuggling route when <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF></COREF> were surrounded and killed by insurgent snipers /.
Now all of this violence has been located in <COREF ID="333" TYPE="IDENT">an area known as the Euphrates river valley</COREF> /.
This is the main smuggling route for <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">insurgents</COREF> from the Syrian border into central Iraq /.
There have been several marine operations in <COREF ID="333" TYPE="IDENT">that area</COREF> since May to try to shut down those smuggling routes /.
But today and <COREF ID="311" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> 's attacks show that <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the insurgents</COREF> are still very resilient /.

<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Tuesday night</COREF> in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">an <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> district <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> carried by thirty points</COREF> it was a victory for <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Rebuplican anti-abortion advocate Jean Schmidt</COREF> /.
Well ladies and gentlemen we passed <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the test</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the GOP</COREF> did not pass <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> by much /.
<COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Schmidt</COREF> won by <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">only four percentage points</COREF> over <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">Democrat Paul Hackett</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">Hackett</COREF> is a political newcomer and a veteran of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> War</COREF> /.
Knock off the crying /.
There 's nothing to cry about here /.
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was a success /.
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was the closest any Democratic congressional candidate has come to beating a Republican here in more than twenty years /.
And <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> the Cincinnati Inquirer called <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the narrow margin</COREF> quote nothing short of astounding /.
The central issue was <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">Hackett a lawyer and a marine reservist who saw combat during a seven month tour</COREF> bluntly <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">bashed</COREF> <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> calling <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> quote a chickenhawk and worse quote a son of a bitch /.
Who <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">says</COREF> bring it on is a cheerleader for the insurgents /.
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's dangerous /.
<COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Schmidt a state lawmaker who believes schools should display the ten commandments</COREF> urged voters to punish <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">Hackett</COREF> for <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">his</COREF> criticism of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF></COREF> /.
And the national GOP poured in half a million dollars in <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" S_OFF="5" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">anti-Hackett</COREF> television ads /.
<COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">He</COREF> supports raising social security taxes /.
The effort according to Republicans was to help <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Schmidt</COREF> quote bury <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">him</COREF> /.
But it was an extremely shallow grave /.
And political analysts say <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the closer than expected outcome</COREF> offers several lessons /.
First of all voters now appear to be more receptive to criticism of <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> approach to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> and skeptical of blanket support like <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Schmidt 's</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> know that <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're on the right track in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to stay the course /.
One analyst says that if the fourteen marines from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> killed <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> had been ambushed last week the election results might have been reversed /.
Secondly <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Schmidt 's</COREF> close call may suggest that aligning with <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> on immigration and social security is precarious /.
And finally there is an advantage to campaigning as a political outsider /.
<COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">I</COREF> 'm running because uh <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">I</COREF> actually want to go to <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> and fight for regular Americans /.
While campaigning <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">Hackett</COREF> repeatedly criticized the leadership of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican party</COREF> and argued that power brokers including Tom DeLay must be replaced /.
When <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">lawmakers</COREF> come back in September though it is a Republican who will be joining <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in Congress and a Democrat who will be staying home /.
The question is was the anti-war sentiment in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio 's</COREF> second congressional district</COREF> a national bell weather signalling things to come /?

you know <COREF ID="375" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think it was a wake - up call particularly for those Republicans that campaign like Ronald Reagan and then govern like Mike Dukakis /.

And <COREF ID="375" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think that is a wake - up call /.
And if the Republican party uh grasps that then we will go about the business of reestablishing the line of distinction between Republicans and Democrats particularly on fiscal matters because <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> do n't represent change /.
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not saying <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want to cut taxes and grow out our economy and create jobs /.
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're not saying <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want a right - sized government to make sure that we check runaway state government spending and put more emphasis on the private sector /.
So <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't represent any change but the change of being from the outside to the inside /.
And so Republicans that are going to be successful next year are Republicans that show a real distinction between the status quo and getting our economy moving again by cutting taxes and right - sizing government /.

uh I think <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Secretary of State of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">your</COREF> state</COREF></COREF> seems like <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's trashing <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush who 's running a half trillion dollar deficit</COREF> for not being a real conservative /.
Yeah <COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> look at who <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">conservatives</COREF> really are /.
what <COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> always learned was that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wanted smaller government uh not no national debt and <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wanted to stay out of foreign entanglements /.
and we 're seeing exactly the opposite /.
But what happened in southwest Ohio <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Secretary Blackwell</COREF> 's right /.
it 's a wake - up call with <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a message</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> do n't know what Mike Dukakis has to do with it /.
But <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the message</COREF> clearly is that the ethical problems in Columbus the ties of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">this candidate that barely squeaked through <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">this election</COREF> when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> carried <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that district</COREF> two to one and the former congressman carried <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> almost three to one</COREF> the ties <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Secretary Blackwell</COREF> to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Taft</COREF> to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> /-
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> made rowboat calls in to every Republican voter in <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that district</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> barely won /.
<COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> think that 's the message that /-
What does that mean in <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> would n't want to be on the ballot next year running for governor if <COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> were <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Ken Blackwell</COREF> or anyone else /.
Did <COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">you</COREF> associate uh /-
<COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> 'm not sure /-
not much internationally /.
<COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">Congressman</COREF> do <COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">you</COREF> associate with the remarks of uh <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Hackett the fellow who lost <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the race</COREF> last night who used <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">terms like son of a bitch and chicken hawk</COREF></COREF> /?
Do <COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> are appropriate terms to refer to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the President of the United States</COREF> with /?
Well <COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> think that uh <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hackett</COREF> /-
Considering <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in Iraq <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't think the war was a good idea to begin with /.
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> stood with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> commander in chief</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has heard <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> and the Vice President accuse uh <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">people who disagree with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> war policy like <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Hackett</COREF></COREF> /.
has accused <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> of not being patriotic /.
<COREF ID="376" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> think whatever <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hackett</COREF> said was understandable /.
But the issue is that <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Hackett</COREF> <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">ran</COREF> incredibly well when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> put <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> name on the line and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Bob Taft</COREF> put <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> name on the line in <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that district</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> tells you then the problems that both the national and state Republicans have /.

<COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> , <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think the Secretary of Defense and all others who are responsible for offering that sort of leadership in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> have <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">those same objectives</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think to try to undercut that resolve and to second - guess <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the Commander in Chief</COREF> is a mistake /.
Let <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">me</COREF> just say to <COREF ID="347" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">you</COREF> <COREF ID="347" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">Chris</COREF> that what <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> said was that <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Ronald Reagan and George Bush</COREF> cut taxes and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> started to restrain state government spending /.
What has happened in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the state of Ohio</COREF> is that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Bob Taft</COREF> has increased spending and <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has in fact raised taxes /.
And <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">anybody that runs on a tax raising runaway spending platform</COREF> is going to lose because <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going to undercut our base /.
And let <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">me</COREF> say to <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the congressman</COREF> that the Oversight Committee of the Bureau of Worker 's Comp where <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">all the scandal</COREF> is taking place has <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">five members</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">Two of <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">those members</COREF></COREF> are Democrats /.
two are Republicans /.

You know who <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">one of <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF></COREF> is /?
<COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is Bill Berger who excuse <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">me</COREF> is the president of the <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> uh AFL - CIO /.

Uh eh we /-
That 's inappropriate maybe /.
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> saw <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the prisoners</COREF> from a distance /.
Uh uh one of the things that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> got to do was uh <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> visited an exercise cage with a concrete floor chain link uh walls and ceilings /.
Through the distance you could see like one uh detainee as they call it /.
There was a soccer ball there /.
Uh <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> sort of get um uh a feel for what uh <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">recreation</COREF> 's like /.
Now <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're told that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> for <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">an hour</COREF> everyday /.
Uh <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> come back /.
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ask <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the defense lawyers</COREF> /.

But as <COREF ID="348" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">you</COREF> suggested there 's a bunch of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">these tours</COREF> /.
There have been more than fifty in the last three months more than thirty in the last months /.
Uh <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's such a regular thing down there now that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> went into the maximum security unit and <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">one of the doors</COREF> was open /.
And <COREF ID="380" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mike_Gowan">I</COREF> 'm like why 's <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the door</COREF> open /?
And you walk up to <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
and there 's a sign on <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> that says tour cell /. /.
So <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're used to uh having people come through /.
You go into a sample cell where <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have the prisoners ' uh basic items comfort items laid out /.
and hanging off the wall there 's <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">a book</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> says the Holy Koran /.
So the idea is to show uh lawmakers the better part of what 's happening there /.
Each of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the guides</COREF> pointed out to <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> the black uh arrows that you see everywhere are showing where Mecca is /.

The uh congressmen uh who had security clearances did see <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">a brief uh interrogation</COREF> /.
and uh <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">the military</COREF> said <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was authentic /.
Uh basically it was <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">an inmate who was arguing that <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wanted to uh get back</COREF> /-
<COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> fought or something /.
<COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 'd been moved into one of the stiffer uh areas /.
and <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was arguing to get back into the lower ones /.
But <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> make a big deal about how much negotiating is been doing /.
<COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> say <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> use a lot of positive reinforcements /.
Offer <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">these guys</COREF> pizza , offer <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">these guys</COREF> ice cream um in return for information /.
Now what <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the congressmen</COREF> are asking after three years , how much really useful information do <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">these guys</COREF> have /?
And that 's one of the problems /.
<COREF ID="266" TYPE="IDENT">a new general Jay Hood who 's down there</COREF> clearly wants to shape <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">this place</COREF> up /.
Does n't want an Abu Ghraib on <COREF ID="266" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hands /.
There are cameras everywhere /.
The command staff works inside the wire /.
But a separate question beyond the guys who are working down there is what 's going to be done with <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> /?
And uh <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">the military</COREF> will admit to you at the moment it looks like <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the five hundred people that are currently there</COREF> are going to be there indefinitely and <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't have any charges against <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.

And then <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> says oh <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's from a previous drug use /.
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">his</COREF> contradiction that <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> created , is n't <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a contradiction on one subject matter /.
On one time frame and not on another /.
There are going to be <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">many athletes who uh once this drug testing program was instituted are going to be found uh guilty</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> urine sample is going to come out positive because there will be strong metabolytes /.
But why do n't <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just say I used /-
But that does n't mean <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not abiding by <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> /.
Okay I do n't want to interrupt <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">you</COREF> Dan /.
but why do n't <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> admit <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> broke <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> before so the new drug test will be found to be positive because of previous use /.
then <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wo n't be nailed again /?
It 's very simple /.
They do n't have enough information enough knowledge on how long a metabolyte lasts in an athlete 's system /.

Well now <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the House uh Government Reform Committee which held <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">those hearings</COREF> back in March</COREF> is requesting from Major League Baseball <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the documents relating to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro 's</COREF> drug test</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the drug test results</COREF> on paper</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">Congressman Steven Lynch of Massachusetts</COREF> is a member of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> and is now with us from Boston /.
<COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">Congressman Lynch</COREF> are <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> uh uh /-
uh <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> want to get a hold of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">those documents those drug test results right from <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF></COREF> /?
Certainly uh <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would answer the question that <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Canseco</COREF> has raised about how long uh it was in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> system and whether or not <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was from a residual use /.
What difference does it make whether <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> lied before and was using before and is found out now or <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been using lately /?
Well if <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was using steroids during <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> testimony</COREF> or prior to <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> testimony</COREF> obviously <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has committed perjury and has tried to mislead <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> in an ongoing investigation /.
So uh it has uh a lot to do about what happens next /.
Would <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> like to see <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> charged with perjury uh if there 's evidence now hard evidence to a drug test that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in fact using steroids back then before <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the testimony</COREF> /?
Because there 's only two options here as <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> point out /.
and <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> elucidate this /.
If <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's used <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the drugs</COREF> and never used <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> before since <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the hearings</COREF> that 's almost insane to think <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did that /.
Yeah /.
So uh <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> defense or the defense that <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Canseco</COREF> offered on this show <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">last night</COREF> was that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may have used <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> a while ago in other words before <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> testified that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> never had , therefore <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's guilty of perjury /.
Right /.
<COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> 'm not sure if <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Canseco</COREF> is just offering <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> opinion uh uh /.
Certainly <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF> never contested <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the positive result on <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the test</COREF></COREF> /.
Uh so <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have n't actually got <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in /.
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's agreed today verbally to release <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">all the documents</COREF> /.
However <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> needs to get a similar release from the union because the confidentiality agreement is part of a collective bargaining agreement /.
so <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to go to <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">that step</COREF> as well /.
Yeah but assuming <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> get by <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">that step</COREF> do <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> should be hit with a perjury charge /?
Well if <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> meets the requirements yes /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're trying to protect <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the process</COREF> /.
When <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> come before <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> and <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are sworn to testify truthfully there has to be consequences when <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not do so /.
So <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is about the integrity of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the congressional process</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not about going after <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Palmeiro</COREF> /.
We had <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Ray Garibaldi</COREF> on <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">last night</COREF> who lost <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF> to uh steroid use /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's an athlete /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was trying to make it as a young man /.

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're thinking about how <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can break into the big leagues /.
is <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this ten day suspension</COREF> enough to turn <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> off to drugs /?
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's really a joke if you think about it /.
and if a non-athlete a non-celebrity is uh convicted of simple possession of a schedule three substance like these steroids uh there 's a potential for a year in jail /.
eh in this case <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF> 's looking at <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a ten day suspension</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> still makes over two point eight million dollars a year /.

Oh of course of course /.
Let 's take a look at something that <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">Jose Canseco</COREF> said here last night /.
<COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> want people to understand /.
<COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> said this many times /.
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">My</COREF> attack</COREF> was never on <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> respect <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes</COREF> greatly /.
What <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> needed was one of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes who <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> name in the actual book who are well known uh individuals</COREF> to come forth and say you know what <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">Jose</COREF> 's saying is one hundred percent true /.
Um <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">my</COREF> major attack and <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">my</COREF> only attack</COREF> was on <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Major League Baseball</COREF> and <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the Player 's Association</COREF></COREF> because <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ought to be you know exploited and found out for uh <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the corrupt methods <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> use</COREF> for letting steroids in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the game</COREF> for endorsing steroids in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the game of baseball</COREF> /.
And all of a sudden you know <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">Bud Segal</COREF> <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">says</COREF> <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know anything about <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never say anything /.
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's ridiculous /.
It 's the biggest ongoing joke on the planet right now /.
<COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">Congressman Lynch</COREF> <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> 're concerned about the rights of labor and collective bargaining agreements /.
And certainly many of us are here as well in this country generally /.
And uh so <COREF ID="363" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">I</COREF> respect <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> /.
so let <COREF ID="363" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> this though /.
Do <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> think the unions have done the job here /?
Is it fair to say that <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">Canseco</COREF> 's got it right by saying <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the Player 's Association</COREF> has not been aggressive in getting rid of steroids /?
Well <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> do n't think <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a union problem /.
Why not a union /-
/.
Why is n't <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> a union problem /?
Well well /-
If <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're protecting <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">the players '</COREF> rights and saying <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should n't be tested /.
You watch <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">those lawyers in <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">your</COREF> committee</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were all over the place trying to defend eh <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">the players</COREF> /.
Hey <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> 'm a former union president <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">myself</COREF> and also an attorney that represented a lot of unions /.
<COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> always thought a very strong anti-drug policy was a good thing for <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">my</COREF> union members /.
This is one case where they have <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">turned</COREF> a blind eye to what 's going on in professional sports /.
But <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not the typical position of <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">unions</COREF> /.
No /.
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> usually want <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">a strong anti-drug policy</COREF> to make a better workforce /.
Well of course <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's also for safety reasons at the workplace /.
But let 's get back to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">MLB Major League Baseball</COREF> /.
do <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> believe <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the whole major league uh establishment</COREF> has been benefitting from <COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT">all these homeruns</COREF> all these years and big muscles that produce <COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT">these homeruns</COREF> /?
Absolutely /.
Following the strike <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> think the thing that brought people back to <COREF ID="267" TYPE="IDENT">baseball</COREF> was the big homerun contest between <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">Sosa and Maguire</COREF> eh . and in a very real way <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">steroid use</COREF> /.
if <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">those two gentlemen</COREF> uh you know were guilty of <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and there 's some evidence that <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were uh <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> put people back into the seats /.
So <COREF ID="267" TYPE="IDENT">baseball</COREF> is benefitting by the performance enhancement of the individual players which makes it even more troublesome in terms of eradicating steroid use /.

Let <COREF ID="355" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">you</COREF> about this election we just had /.
Yeah /.
Eh <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we all</COREF> love bi-elections because <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> try to find something in the tea leaves /.
Right /.
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Fifty - two forty - eight</COREF> the Republican won in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">a Republican district</COREF> <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">narrower victory than usual</COREF> /.
But what 's interesting is <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">this guy Paul Hackett who was on this show last week</COREF> used the most amazing language in describing <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the President of the United States</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> called <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="355" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">I</COREF> do n't use <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">this phrase</COREF> often <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">son of a bitch</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">I</COREF> understand /.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> called <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">a chickenhawk</COREF> /.
We know what <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> means /.
And <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still got forty - eight percent /.
<COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">Ed Rogers /.</COREF>
Well there was a lot about this race that was an aberration /.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was a good articulate candidate /.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> used some harsh language that <COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">I</COREF> would disagree with /.
but nonetheless <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had a legitimate point of view /.
and <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was the darling of the media and of the left /.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had a lot of resources in a special election where there was turnout that was less than half of what would normally turn out in a normal election in a regularly scheduled election /.
And <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> should n't take too much comfort in an election where <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just got beat versus an election where <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> got slaughtered /.
So /-
<COREF ID="359" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">Bob Shrum</COREF> what do <COREF ID="359" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">you</COREF> make of this /?
/.
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> was a nice piece of spin <COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">Ed</COREF> /.
but the fact is that /-

But the /-
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a nice piece of spin /.
Right /.
And the fact is <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">that district</COREF> is normally won by <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Republicans</COREF> by forty points /.
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> won by four points /.
If you see <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">that kind of shift</COREF> or anything approaching <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> next year or something much less than <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> you 're going to see nineteen ninety four in reverse /.
And what <COREF ID="359" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really reflects is not any language that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Hackett</COREF> used /-
/.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> might have actually done better had <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> not said some of those things /.
What it really reflects is dissatisfaction with the war a failed privatization plan on social security and a sense that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> has put no priority on <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">healthcare and education</COREF> /.

Well <COREF ID="358" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">I</COREF> do n't know /.
but the country might do better /.
we know it /.
be over /.
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not going to happen /.
there are real differences between the parties here /.
There <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> real differences on some big issues /.
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's right /.
And you notice <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Joe Biden</COREF> would like <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">John McCain</COREF> to run with <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">John McCain</COREF> 's running for president in <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican Party</COREF> /.
Yes /.
And <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">I</COREF> do n't think <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to pick <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Joe Biden</COREF> as <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> vice-presidential nominee if <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets nominated /.
and <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">I</COREF> do n't think the convention would go along with <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
Let <COREF ID="358" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">you</COREF> <COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">Ed</COREF> since <COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">you</COREF> 're the Republican of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">this duo</COREF> do <COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">your</COREF> party</COREF> will become pragmatic when it becomes closer and closer to the prospect of not only confronting <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton</COREF> in the general election in <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">two thousand eight</COREF> but possibly losing to <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /?
Will <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">your</COREF> party</COREF> straighten up and say damn it <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have to drop some of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> ideological baggage /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've got to run the best possible candidate /?
You know uh in February and March of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">two thousand and eight</COREF> pragmatism and a collective calculus on behalf of <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Republican primary voters</COREF> will not be what carries the day /.
<COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ed_Rogers">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> voters</COREF> will probably go with a stylistical contrast to Bush somewhat /.
Voters usually do /.
Sure a little change /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> tend to nominate a front runner /.
So a front runner in <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">our party</COREF> has to really falter before <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll go back into the pack /.
But is there going to be some sort of collective calculus /?
Whose turn is it /?
$Whose turn for is it party /?
No /.
Is it <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">McCain 's</COREF> turn having lost last time or not /?
Historically speaking yes /.
If <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> were to tend to it , if <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> were to listen to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> advisors and try <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be hard to beat /.
Right /.
Is <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> the hardest uh Republican candidate for the Democrats to beat <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">Bob</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">McCain</COREF> /?
Uh well <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">I</COREF> think everything /-

but of course <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">my</COREF> saying <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may in fact convey <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the opposite impression</COREF> to people /.
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> may think <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bob_Shrum">I</COREF> 'm trying to convey <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the opposite impression</COREF> /.
