### NER Tools

spaCy, stanza (stanfordnlp), NLTK, and flair provide popular NLP toolkits. We evaluate the performance of their NER utilities on maintenance data.

See comparison_ner.csv for their output side by side, and notebooks/explorations/ner_eval.ipynb to see an evaluation on each tool.

Note that nltk is not included in comparison_ner.csv. This is because it did not give trustworthy results, as is explained in nltk/README.md
